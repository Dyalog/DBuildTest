 test_assert←{⍝ this test shows how to write tests a dfns

⍝ it is a sample - but testing the Assert function will require calling this or other tests with DTest and checking we get the right results!
⍝ as done in test_SuccessValue.dyalog

     sink←1 Assert 0.5+0.5                ⍝this should not fail

     1 Assert 0*0:    ⍝ here we give a reason for the failure

     MyMsg←'Now thats a surprise!' ⍝ result of difficult computations!
     MyMsg⊢1 Assert 2×0.5:      ⍝this is syntax if the msg can not be given in comment, but is result of some other routine

     0<≢MyMsg IfNot 1 Check 1.1:MyMsg

     0  ⍝ empty string as default, indicating "no errors to report"
 }
