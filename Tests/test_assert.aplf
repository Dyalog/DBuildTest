 test_assert←{⍝ this test shows how to write tests a dfns

⍝ it is a sample - but testing the Assert function will require calling this or other tests with DTest and checking we get the right results!
⍝ as done in test_SuccessIndicator.dyalog

⍝ not trying to wstablish a pattern with ⍝[t...] but want  in to make sure (we can check that) the error shows the expected line!

     sink←1 Assert 0.5+0.5                ⍝[t1]: this should not fail

     1 Assert 0*=:'Meaningless'    ⍝ the guard will never will be executed, because Assert's ⎕SIGNAL will terminate test

     MyMsg←'Now thats a surprise!' ⍝ result of difficult computations!
     sink←MyMsg IfNot 1 Assert 1      ⍝this is syntax if the msg can not be given in comment, but is result of some other routine
     ''  ⍝ empty string as default, indicating "no errors to report"
 }
