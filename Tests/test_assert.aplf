 test_assert←{⍝ this test shows how to write tests a dfns

⍝ it is a sample - but testing the Assert function will require calling this or other tests with DTest and checking we get the right results!
⍝ as done in test_SuccessValue.dyalog

     
     ⍝ this should not fail with value 0.5+0.5!
     sink←1 Assert 0.5+0.5 

     1 Assert 0*0:    ⍝ here we give a reason for the failure

     MyMsg←'Error msg computed elsewhere...' ⍝ result of difficult computations!
     MyMsg⊢1 Assert 2×0.5:      ⍝this is syntax if the msg can not be given in comment, but is result of some other routine

     1 Check 1: MyMsg       ⍝ "traditional" checks  return an error msg if test fails

     0  ⍝ empty string as default, indicating "no errors to report"
 }
