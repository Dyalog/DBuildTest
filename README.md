# DBuild

DBuild is a tool to build a distributeable version of your code (currently: a workspace) from source-code in files. DTest supports unit tests. More doc in the [wiki](https://github.com/Dyalog/DBuildTest/wiki).
The only file that is required to run DBuild or DTest is DBuildTest.dyalog, the file CITA.json5 is used to manage the testing of the repository.
